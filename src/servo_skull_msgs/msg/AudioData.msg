# This is a minimal ROS2 message definition for raw audio data.
# You can expand this as needed for your use case.

# The audio data as raw int16 (e.g., PCM 16-bit LE)
int16[] data

# Optionally, you could add sample_rate, channels, etc. for richer messages.
# uint32 sample_rate
# uint8 channels
# uint8 sample_width
